Additionally psionic spells have no verbal or somatic components, instead manifesting a psionic spell is accompanied by a display. A display is a minor secondary effect which may be auditory, material, mental, olfactory, or visual. No power’s display is significant enough to create consequences for the psionic creatures, allies, or opponents during combat. However, such a display makes it clear to nearby creatures that you are casting a spell of some sort. Some psionic spells require that you hold or expend your psionic focus to utilize that power. When a non-psionic spell mentions holding {@book concentration|phb|10|concentration|0} on a spell this is the same as a Psion holding focus. However, expending focus to utilize an ability is unique to a psion, you may regain your spent focus by spending a bonus action. Ending {@book concentration|phb|10|concentration|0} or your held focus is not the same as expending it and this as well as switching {@book concentration|phb|10|concentration|0} or focus can be done at any time allowed by a spell or ability."

This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for {@dice 2d4} days.

								"Psionics, as a form of magic, has some similarities to spellcasting. There are two types of psionic powers: psionic talents and psionic powers.",
								"Psionic talents are cantrips and are similar to arcane or divine cantrips. Their primary distinction is that they have an indefinite duration that lasts for as long as you focus on them. You can only focus on one psionic talent at a time, and you only lose focus if you lose consciousness.",
								"Psionic powers similar to spells in most ways: they have schools of magic, they range from 1st to 9th level, and you can only use (or manifest) them a limited number of times between long rests. They are not spells, however, and rather than expending spell slots, you must expend psi points to manifest them. The number of psi points you have, and the limits of their use, typically depend on your levels in a class that grants psionic powers.",
								"Psionic classes are presented in Chapter 1, while Chapter 4 goes into greater detail on the use of psionic powers during play."
